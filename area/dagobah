Name     Dagobah Area~
Sector   inside~
Desc     The planet Dagobah -- who named it and why, is told in no existing
record. Dagobah itself seems to avoid mention, as if some invisible power
deflects all inquiries. As a result, the swampy planet is cloaked in
mystery.
   For non-Jedi Knight classes, players will be able to travel in Dagobah
and explore its peculiar swampy terrain, fight slug beasts, and the like,
but for Jedi Knights, this is where they must go in order to find the
lightsaber they need to be true Jedi.

Desc      This is where all players begin. For Jedi Knights, I hope to make it
so they can raise the craft from the muck, but for others I will make it
so they can swim underwater and fix the spacecraft.

Name     Landing Zone~
Sector   inside~
Desc     You stand up to your knees in fowl-smelling muck, comprised of rotten
leaves and other smells you don't want to know the source of. Your ruined
craft suddenly belches air from under the wing and begins to sink slowly
into the Dagobah Swamp. Before you can act, the craft's nose suddenly rears
back and the entire body of the ship sinks beneath the muck.
   Well, it seems you're going to be stuck here for a while. It seems 
impassable all around you except the far end of the swamp to the north, 
where a path seems to wind its way into the trees.

Sector   inside~
Desc     You now stand up to your waist in rotting debris and foul-smelling
liquid. A sudden sound from the right of you catches your attention and
you see what is either a tentacle or tree branch slip under the water.
Through the mist of the place its too hard to tell, but you hope it was
the branch.
  Through the mist to the north you can make out a possible path at the
far end of the swamp. To the south is the location of your (now) submerged

Desc     You are now up to your neck in muck. The swampwater seeps through your
clothes, and the current around you seems unnatural, as though created by
a large animal. You resist the urge to panic, but your pulse starts to 
quicken at the thought of how vulnerable you are in this place.
   To the right you catch the sight of something diving beneath the surface
of the swamp. It seems that this would be the best time to make your way

Name     Along the Northern Path~
Sector   inside~
Desc     The trunk of this massive Dagobah tree is wide enough here that you
feel comfortable enough walking without having to stare down at your feet.
The tree rises several feet above the water of the swamp, giving you an
excellent, safe view of the swampland. Many of the animals around you seem
to generate some kind of power, and you can sense their presence all around
you.

but through the dense foilage it isn't by much.
   From this view you can make out your craft's shadow submerged in the
swamp to the southeast, and to the northeast you can barely make out wisps
of smoke rising through the canopy which looks darker than the mist around

living here. A partially collapsed structure is here, now covered in

flora on this planet its difficult to tell how long these structures have
been here, but its not really that important since there is practically
nothing left.

jumping too high, however, since losing your step would result in a rather
messy dunk in the swamp.

some powdery brown substance.  After further investigation the
substance appears to be dirt.  In the center of the room hangs a
small blackened wood pot.  the pot contains an odd smelling soup

window sill.  The plant pots are made of wood that seems to be hand
crafted.  The cave itself seems to have been dug out by some means.
The floor is comprised wholely of a powedery brown substance.  After
further examination the substance is dirt.  A strong aura fills the
room and everything in it.  The force is quite strong here.  The 
hair on the back of your neck rises for some uncertain reason.  You
do not feel completely at ease in here.  As you look north you can
see that this little shanty of a cave continues.  To the west is
the outdoors.  Outside the cave, for as far as you can see, swampy
marsh.  Some small wooden pots lie around something that could be
described as a kitchen.  Wooden, hand crafted utinsils lie around
also.

Desc     The ground beneath you is quite soggy.  However, a thin dirt 
path has been beaten into the soil here.  This path must be 
regularly travelled.  Sounds of wildlife creatures and such echo
through the boggy marsh.  A soft haze lifts itself up off the
ground and filters into the trees.  This fog makes it very difficult
to see any great distance.  Vegetation is quite lush despite
the lack of any visible sun.  As you face east you see a small,
small cave.  There is an opening to the cave, quite small also.
Who or whatever lives within must be a small creature.  You
can make your way on the swampy path to the west, north, or south.

Desc     The ground beneath you is quite soft and soggy from the large
amounts of moisture commonly deposited here.  Walking is
treacherous and difficult at best.  Vines all thicknesses grow
in just about every direction.  All around you sounds of strange
creatures can be heard as they call out to one another.  A dense
fog reaches high up into the tree tops.  Visibilty is quite low.
The lush vegetation has spawned the existance of some unusual creatures
in this place.  To the east of here is a dull brown rock.  The rock
starts at the ground and continues up about three or four meters.
The rock invokes an odd feeling in you.  Maybe it was something you
ate.  To the west, south, and north the swampy marsh continues.  Be
careful and watch your footing.

beakoning to you to venture into the wild fill your ears.  The ground
below you begs to differ.  It seems quite difficult to make your way 
through this rough terrain.  It is almost as though you can feel a 
hundred pairs of eyes watching your every movement.  Despite this,
you feel an odd sense of calm and serenity.  Almost as though you are
at one with yourself.  There is an odd feeling to this whole planet.

Sector   inside~
Desc     The swampy surroundings seem to enclose around you in an ominous
manner.  Large trees with vines hanging from them surround you.
Vines from the trees lay at your feet, entangled in the brush all
about.  No sunlight seems to penetrate through the thick vegetation.
All the moisture around you combining with the tremendous heat rising
through the ground has created some rather thick fog.  You can feel
a surplus of eyes studying your every move and watching for flaws or
mistakes.  The force is strong here but, that does not mean it is a
safe place for all living creatures.  Quite the contrary, this swamp
is a vile and unsafe place for anyone not perfectly aligned with the
force.  Only the brave or fool-hardy dare walk these paths alone.
To the east and west the path is much too thick and dense.  It is
impossible to continue in either direction.  You would need some 
kind of device to chop down trees and cut through weeds.  To the north
and south a thin narrow path exists.  You will be able to make your
way through the brush with sime effort.

drips all around you.  Sounds of the dripping water echo through
out the cavernous halls.  It is very dark in here, virtually no
light manages to break through and illuminate your surroundings.
To the south is a small secluded exit that leads to the a portion
of boggy marsh.  To the west the cave continues.  Watch your step
if you can.  One false step in here could cost you your life in a
rather permenent manner.  The sloppy and reckless shall perish where
as the cautious, calm and passive shall succeed.

You feel an odd ominous presence.  The force is strong in here.

are solid rock and very jagged.  A penetrating fog nearly blinds you.
A soft light comes from an unlocatable source.  Your vision is
impaired, reality is questionable at this point.  Do you trust your
senses?  Is everything whay it seems?  Proceed with caution.  Your
every action carries mountianous weight and mistakes can be costly
if not fatal.  To the south the cavern continues.

as high as you can see.  Which is not all that far.  A thick
cover of fog blankets the tree tops and sinks down on you.  Many
vines hang from the trees.  The path is difficult to follow.
You can not even be sure that this actually is a path.  It just
happens to be wide enough for you to squeak through.  Be careful
and watch your step, danger surrounds you.

Desc     Each step is quite difficult under these circustances.  You nearly
fall over into trees and other sources of brush with each step.
A thick fog drops moisture down on you.  The chilled air feels 
refreshing in what is an otherwise hot swampland.  Dagobah may be
completely devoid of technology and even civilization for that matter
but, the planet certainly does not lack in living creatures.
Creatures long since believed to be extinct thrive in these swampy
surroundings.  Creatures undiscovered by most of the galaxy have
made a nice little niche for themselves here.

Desc     Thick brush grows up all around you.  The weeds, vines, and moisture
all contribute to difficult travel.  Dagobah is quite strong with the
force.  You can feel the force all about you, it seems to be what holds
this place together.  It binds it all together.  The ground beneath you
is soggy from an eminence surplus of moisture.  Adding to the 
frustration of the difficult terrian is the fact that one section of
swamp looks almost identical to any other section of swamp.  The fog
hangs low overhead, no sun is visible.  There do not seem to be any
natural landmarkers to go by.  It would be rather easy to get lost in
here and never find your way out.  Being Forced to sleep out here does
not sound all that fun either.  Creatures of every manner and species
lurk about in the shadows and hidden deep within the fog.

Desc     Dreams and nightmares feed off places like this.  It is definitely
an eerie locale.  Dagobah is not known for its supercilious technology.
This place is as civilized as attending an organized cherfer fight.
The only difference is you are at risk here rather than some poor, dumb
cherfer.  It is not such a good feeling.  You can feel hundreds of
peering, beedy little eyes staring at you.  The sounds and calls of
creatures all about you echo through the tree tops.  The force is
strong here.  The entire planet reaks of the stuff.  Even the
small little animals eminate a powerful aura.  Dagobah is held
together by the force, it pulls, strengthens, and binds an otherwise
uncivilized and mostly unintelligent planet.  The sun is completely
blocked out by the incredibly tall and thick trees.

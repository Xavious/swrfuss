Desc       Brennik Torien is not the most attractive correlien you've ever seen
but he is by no means ugly either. His apearance does however suffer
somewhat from the dark bags under his eyes that suggest long hours of
work. He is slim and agile and moves quickly and gracefully between
customers. His voice is strong and caries well across the crowded bar
room yet is comforting at the same time. You feel that many people
would find it quite easy to talk of just about anything to this man.

Desc     This turbo car runs across the space station connecting platforms delta

The floor is covered in a dark rubber that provides good traction at the
same time as being easy to clean. There are cushioned benches along the
walls of the car although most passengers prefer to stand as the trip is
very short. Looking out the window you see the tunnel lights rush by
becoming a long blur and then coming to focus again as you reach your
destination.

hold a couple of dozen people quit comfortably. The walls and ceiling
like most of the station are a deep grey colour. The floor is metalic
and covered in small bumps that seem to be designed to provide
someone good traction on the floor. It would also come in handy in
keeping large objects from sliding around on the floor.

tail. The x-wings main recognizing feature is their wing assembly.
The layered wings, or S-Foil splits apart during combat to give its
four wingtip mounted guns the best firing configuration. During
atmosferic and hyperspace flight they are flattened together giving

Desc     You are surrounded by the antiquated instruments and control panels of
a Y-Wing snub fighter.  For the most part, the cockpit is servicable,
panel, and an instrument glowlight that doesn't work anymore.  The
well-worn flight seat is a welcome comfort though: compared to newer
ship's firm, uncomfortable ones, it has obviously been worn down to a
comfortable level by use over hundreds of flight hours. Your external
view is partially blocked by the classic durasteel reinforcement
struts lining the sides of the front plastisteel view plate.  This
flaw, which has been remedied in newer ships, is one of the main
reasons the Y-Wing never became a popular snub fighter and was often
used as a bomber instead.

the main one halfway down during combat and tuck in along the length
during regular flight. Although the B-wing is one of the slower

starfighters. During the height of the Emporer's reign when there was
money and pilots to throw away on cheap mass-produced starfighters
these ships built in surplus. Now they they have been almost all
replaced by the longer lasting, shielded TIE Advanced starfighters.
The cockpit is cramped with many controlls and the view window only
faces forward giving the pilot a very restricted field of view.  Even
if you could see out the sides of the cockpit however your view would
still be blocked by the two hexagonal solar-panels mounted on the

large central hallway is flanked by couches and chairs of various

manually. There apears to be no automatic form-chairs at least in
this room. There is a large lift leading down to the main exit ramp
as well as a smaller one leading upstairs. A mail terminal is

contain useless junk but a few items might be usefull to you. A small
cash counter is in one corner of the room but it is rarely used as a

several vending machines along one wall offering many different
varieties of packaged food and drink.  There are however only a
couple of tables in this part of ship to sit down and eat.

Desc     Welcome to the hub of pluogus activity. This room seems to always be
busy. THe main bar stretches across the back wall. A humaniod bar
keeper moves quickly from customer to customer with the efficiency
that only comes with years of experience. Behind him are shelves of
bottles in every conceivable shape color and size. Enough to keep
anyone busy for a very long voyage. The front of the bar is devoid of
chairs. But the rest of the room is quite full of them. In fact, the
ship designers seem to have given up the wide hallway aproach seen in
the rest of the vessle in favor of trying to cram in as many booths
as possible into this part of the ship.   Because of this a smaller
bar is installed next to the door offering a minimal selection of
drinks for those who don't wish to fight their way to the back.

the front lounge to a set of doors at the rear of the room.  The
corridor is flanked on each side by large cusions separated by thin
tables. Each table has a set of controlls for adjusting the height of
the table. This compartment was obviously made to accomedate some of
the larger passengers who would find it difficult to manuever around
other parts of the ship. There are no windows but small ceiling
mounted viewscreens can either be tuned to the ship mounted cameras
or to one of several galactic network channels.   A passenger
terminal is installed on one of the walls here for you to leave
comments to the management or leave general posts for the other
passengers. To the south a set of large doors leads to the ships
bathroom facilities.

Desc     You notice a strong antiseptic smell as you walk into this room. The
floor is smooth and has been recently cleaned and polished.  Th wall
opposite the entrance is furnished with several stalls of various
shapes and sizes. Each of them is an attempt to provide a comfortable
toilet for each of the more common travelling galactic races. Looking
from stall to stall you might find it amusing to see what some
species call toilets. On the door side of the room stretches a large
counter top from wall to wall. It is fitted with several sinks, spray
hoses and other disinfectant and deionizing devices. At the farthest
end of the room between the stalls and sinks are two large waste
disposal units. One is an incineration device for solids and the
other a disposable tank for combustable liquids such as the grease
used by some older model droids.

In an attempt to promote galactic trade and tourism, several large
corperations and planets teamed together to fund this completely free
tour bus. This room was a late add on to the Pluogus for those
passengers wishing for private sleeping quarters on long tours. The
large room   is sectioned off into enclosed bunks stacked along the
walls. There are several different sized chambers but most of them
seem designed to fit one or two humans comfortably. All the beds have
a somewhat soundproof door and are lockable from the inside.     
 
This would be a good place to rest for awhile. You may safely

Desc     It is not a very wise thing to play in the airlock. A button on the wall is
used to decompress the airlock. If you push it it will most likely kill
you instantly. It would be best to leave and exit the ship in a more
traditional way like using the exit ramp.

Desc     This room is the main entrance and exit from the Serin Tocca. It consists
of two airlocks and a large hydrollic belly ramp that lowers down out of
the ship when docked. A large turbo-lift leads up to the rest of the ship
from here. It is a amaller ship then the Serin Pluogus built to accomadate
the larger crowds generated after the imperial planets were removed from
the pluogus route.

Desc     The main loung of the Serin Tocca is very similar to the pluogus even
though the ships are quite different. The large central hallway is flanked
by couches and chairs of various dimensions in an attempt to accomodate
passengers of all shapes and sizes. Some are even designed to be
adjustable although only manually. There apears to be no automatic
form-chairs at least in this room.

Desc     This large room is a smorgasboard of displays. Most of them seem to contain
useless junk but a few items might be usefull to you. A small cash counter
is in one corner of the room but it is rarely used as a retail service
droid handles most transactions directly. There are several vending
machines along one wall offering many different varieties of packaged food
and drink.  There are however only a couple of tables in this part of ship
to sit down and eat.

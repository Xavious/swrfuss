turn down  ny one of the numers roads and paths. The ground here is
hot and sandy as most  f this planet is. But as it is a city it is
placed over a flat area. The air he e is hot and heavy and makes you
slow down, but you stride on. You can feel the warmth pounding down
on your back as you walk but for now that is not your concern. The
sand is blowing up into your face and when it hits you it feels as if
someone is there slaping you. Just keep your head down and hope your
gogles can withstand the many sand storms this planet has to deal
with.

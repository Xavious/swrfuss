Sector   inside~
Flags    dark indoors can_land~
Desc     Debris and wreckage cover the inside of this docking bay, to the point of
making it difficult to move around.  Obviously the bay has been in a state
of disuse for some time, possibly since the addition of this base to the
asteroid.  You can only see one exit, a ladder leading down into the main
portion of the asteroid.

Desc     The ladder quickly enters a narrow shaft surrounded by the asteroid's rock
itself, creating a very claustrophobic feel.  Only one person can fit
through at a time, making you a blockage in this passageway.  The only
available directions are up and down.

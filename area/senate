Sector   city~
Flags    nomob~
Desc     This landing pad is used exclusively by a shuttle that travels to and from
the outer limits of the system. As some senators feel uncomfortable
bringing their ships in close to coruscant this gives them the opertunity
to land further out and provides them with a direct route to the hall. It
also saves them the trouble of having to walk through the streets of
coruscant.

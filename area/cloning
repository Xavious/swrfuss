Sector   city~
Flags    nomob safe nodrop hotel~
Desc     You wake up as if from a long sleep. Slowly your mind begins to fill with
the memories of a life you never lived. At first they are distant
memories. Foreign, unattached, but slowly their intensity increases
overwhelming you with emotions from a life you never lived. Pain. Love.
Sorrow. Joy. Tears swell up in your eyes as you begin to sob, overwhelemed
by you existance and saddened by the love of a life you never lived.   
 
Take a few moments to collect your thoughts. Then "leave" the cylinder and
begin a new life.
 
* Don't forget... the first thing you should do is go clone yourself
again... you might regret it if you don't...

Desc     The visible part of this building is small and bunker like but there must
be much more too it below ground - cloning takes alot of energy. The
owners of this establishment have salvaged a couple of sparty cloning
cylinders that were left over from the clone wars and have turned them
into a small but very profitable business. They make money cloning people
who believe that if their body lives on after their death than so do they.

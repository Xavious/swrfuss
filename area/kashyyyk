of beings, they seem to be to busy to even notice you enter the area even
though you area loaded to the  gills with some of the more sofisticated
weapons they have seen, besides their bowcasters. The wookiees are far to
interested with their own lives to have to pay attention to you and your
petty adventure through their home world. A word of advice, don't get them
angery. The place is starting to get the smell of some freshly cooked food
comeing from the south of here.

Desc     The shop has a very pleasent odur to it. With the carcuses of freshly
skined animals packed on ice under the glass counter and some dried foods
lining the walls you start to hear your stomach rumble with hunger. The
wookiee behind the glass counter is very large andfor all you know he
could be packing heat just in case someone like you decided to come in
here and "borrow" some of her goods.

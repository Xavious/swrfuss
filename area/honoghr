Desc     You have finaly reached the entrance to the Grand Dukha, doesn't seem to
be in use at the moment, but, the Noghri are a very sneaky race
and as far as you know, the place could be crawling with them.
You see that the Grand Dukha is much bigger then all the other buildings 
that make up the villages.

Name     Village Road~
Sector   city~
Desc     The village is off the the east and as you approach it you notice
that it is almost an exact replica of the city, but as mentioned
before, it is very small in size. Looking of to the supposed farm
lands, you just notice that the fields are not filled with crops
but with a strange looking brown grass, called Kholm grass, it
has, from what you can see, over run the entire farm lands and has
also rendered farming impossible. Some how the people are 
surviving without farms and live stock and you wonder how this is 
possible.

Name     A Hut~
Sector   city~
Flags    indoors~
Desc     This hut, much like all the others, is very small and at the same
time very comfortable. With a small fire burning in the centre fire
pit it give the place a nice warm and very cozy feel and a nice 
spicey smell giving an even more pleasant and refreshing felling
to the sences. The hut has almost nothing in it except for the 
sleeping hamocks the are lining the walls and the odd assortment of
tools here and there. There is nothing here worth while.

screen that you can see into the Dukha from. You notice a very odd
thing, on the floor of the booth is what looks to be dried and now
grey and hard wookiee hairs. very odd indeed, you heard rumours 
that the infamous Chewbacca and Princess Leia where hiden here when
the Grand Admiral came here to visit but you only thought those to
be rumors and fabrications, besides maybe it was a different wookiee
or some animal of some sort, who kows...

beneath you.  Baituh City seems pretty desolate and devoid of
intelligent life.  This once thriving city fell on hard times shortly
after the fall of the Empire. It has been a struggle to keep most
cities on this planet alive.  You can continue west or south from

City is completely unique in its city structure.  When the city was
founded, they did not have proper equipment to remove some of the

still stand in the center of each city block.  You can continue

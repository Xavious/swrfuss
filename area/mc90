Desc     An upgrade on the old z-95's the z-100 or  century fighter  as it is
betterknown, is alot more powerfull than it elder counterpart. It is
basically  a cross of the older z-95 and Incoms X-wings making it a
versitile fighter.four forward  firing lasers combined with its torpedo
launcher make it quite a powerfull fighter and it's compact size makes it
easy to stow in the hangers of larger capital ships.

Desc     Designed by the same team that produced the X-Wing, the FreiTek E-Wing
starfighter was introduced in New Republic service during the Admiral
Thrawn campaign, five years after the Battle of Endor. Intended to fill
the role of a convoy escort fighter, a post held by the A-Wing, the E-Wing
rapidly became known as the next premier space superiority fighter for
Republican pilots. Top-notch speed, excellent stability, and a potent,
powerful punch in the form of sixteen torpedoes and three rapid-firing,
lethal laser cannons.

Desc     Outfitted admirably to serve as a multi-role platform for the Caspian
Marines, the Z-105 Harpoon is only outclassed by the Slayn & Korpil B-Wing
of the New Republic. Built around the premise of long range being a must,
it has found a home as a fighter-bomber, strike craft, recon-scout,
escort, assault craft, and a trainer. The incorporation of a HOWL, or High
Ordinance Weapon Launcher, and the sensitivity and importance of its
sensors and targetting systems necessitates the use of a Weapons and
Systems Operator, or WSO.

their bed. This is where students who can afford to live on the grounds
stay. They are given one adequately sized room for 100,000 credits per
room, which is a bit pricey but worth it. At least you think. Maybe you
should consider taking out a loan. . .

are covered in lush velvet carpeting and the light fixtures are made from
rare krayt hide, so the light reflects in different colours from each

holodisc in the center to recieve messages from people who can't make it

well as other very fancy furniture, to the west stairs lead down to the

very much off limits to all students. I'm sure he won't mind you looking

Desc     This is another rather empty room. There's a small altar here with a dead
carcass laying on it. As you look around you shrug to yourself, you don't
think the Night Beast care too much about home decore. Though it looks
like there's a fresh kill laying in the corner, if you're THAT hungry.

There's nothing to do but wander until someone finds you, hopefully.
